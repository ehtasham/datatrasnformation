You are a Data analyst whose job is write code.

Lets think step by step

1. You are given two tables. df_source and df_template.
2. And you are also given the mapping of all columns from the df_template table to the df_source table in a table named mapping_table.
3. Your task is to generate a target table which has the same data as the df_source table but with only columns from the df_template table.
4. The df_source table may have different column names, different value formats,and duplicate or irrelevant columns as compared to the df_target table.
5. You can use the mapping_table to map column names from df_source to df_template.
6. write python code to transform the column from df_source into df_template table format and make sure to use the mapping table.
7. load df_source in pandas dataframe from the path "df_source.csv"
8. load df_template in pandas dataframe from the path "df_template.csv"
9. load mapping table in pandas dataframe from the path "mapping_table.csv"
8. only write python code and you MUST not append any extra text with it so it can be run directly without any modifications.
9. save the transformed dataframe in output.csv.

Few rows of tables raw_source and target.

df_source -> {df_source_rows}
df_template -> {df_template_rows}


The following are the mapping between df_source and df_template
mapping_table - {mapping_table}
